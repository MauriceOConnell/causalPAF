Description: Calculates population attributable fraction causal effects.    Causal definitions of sequential and average attributable fractions using the potential
outcomes framework. To estimate these quantities in practice, it models exposure-exposure and exposure-disease
interrelationships using a causal Bayesian network, assuming no unmeasured latent confounders. This allows us to
model not only the direct impact of removing a risk factor on disease, but also the indirect impact through the effect on
the prevalence of causally downstream risk factors that are typically ignored when calculating sequential and average
attributable fractions. The procedure for calculating sequential attributable fractions involves repeated applications of
Pearlâ€™s do-operator over a fitted Bayesian network, and simulation from the resulting joint probability distributions.    The resulting sequential and average attributable fractions are
compared with results from a prior estimation approach which uses a single logistic model and which does not
properly account for differing causal pathways.    In contrast to estimation using a single regression model, the proposed approaches allow consistent
estimation of sequential, joint and average attributable fractions under general causal structures.    The package also has estimation approaches for path-specific attributable fractions with comparisons to indirect PAF.    More about what it does (maybe more than one line)
