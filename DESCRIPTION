Description: Calculates population attributable fraction causal effects.
    The causalPAF package contains a suite of functions for causal
    analysis calculations of population attributable fractions (PAF) given
    a causal diagram which apply both: Pathway-specific population
    attributable fractions (PS-PAFs) and Sequential population
    attributable fractions.  Results are presentable in both table and
    plot format.
