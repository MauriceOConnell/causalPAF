#' @description Calculation of Population Attributable Fraction (PAF), with a decomposition of the total PAF into direct
#' and indirect components. It performs one simulation which can be combined with a bootstrap approach to
#' perform multiple simulations. If we think of \eqn{Y_0} as the potential outcome for
#' an individual if they were never exposed to the risk factor, can be directly interpreted as the relative change in
#' disease prevalence if an exposure was absent from the population.
#' Sjolander introduced the ideas of mediation into the literature for PAF, defining a decomposition of the total PAF
#'  into direct and indirect components:  and

#' A numeric n x \eqn{1} vector where n is the number of patients in the case control data frame.
#' For case control studies, a reweighting approach is used which assumes the prevalence of disease,
#' pi is known, and the sampled disease cases and controls are randomly selected from their respective populations.
#' We assume for simplicity that the case to control matching ratio is \eqn{1} to r, for some r greater than \eqn{1}.
#' Under these assumptions, the components of the PAF can be found as the corresponding empirical expectations
#' and distributions in the reweighted dataset where cases are assigned weights \eqn{1}, and controls are assigned weights
#'  \eqn{(1/pi − 1)/r}. Effectively then we can think of the reweighted population as a random sample.
