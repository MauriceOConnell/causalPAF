 #The causal analysis requires that the causal structure is a Markov DAG. The Causal Markov (CM)
 # condition states that, conditional on the set of all its direct causes, a node is independent
 # of all variables which are not direct causes or direct effects of that node. In the event that
 # the structure of a Bayesian network accurately depicts causality, the two conditions are

 # causal DAG supplied in the in _outArg. Alternatively the user can supply their custom fitted,
 # model_listpop, response_model_mediators and response_model_exposure which should be consistent
 # with the causal structure.

 # Note we fit a custom interaction for the outcome (or case or response) regression
 # ( custom = "regionnn7*ns(eage,df=5)+esex*ns(eage,df=5)") ). Care should be taken that the

 # esex) with interactions and splines. In general, using baseline confounders in custom should
 # not affect any causal interpretations whereas using variables far ``downstream'' might block
 # causal pathways. The user is required to apply discretion in using ``addCustom'' and
 # ``Custom'' in ensuring a causal interpretation remains. If no customisation is required the
 # user can input addCustom = FALSE and custom = "" which is the default setting.

 # Finally we call the causalPAFplot function for the pathway-specific PAF calculations as
