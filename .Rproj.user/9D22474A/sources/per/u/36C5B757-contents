#' @description Calculation of Population Attributable Fraction (PAF), with a decomposition of the total PAF into direct
#' and indirect components. It performs one simulation which can be combined with a bootstrap approach to
#' perform multiple simulations. If we think of \eqn{Y_0} as the potential outcome for
#' an individual if they were never exposed to the risk factor, can be directly interpreted as the relative change in
#' disease prevalence if an exposure was absent from the population.
#' Sjolander introduced the ideas of mediation into the literature for PAF, defining a decomposition of the total PAF
#'  into direct and indirect components,  and
#' @param data_frame Data frame containing the data. The data frame has cases in rows and variables in columns.
#' @param exposure The exposure name in the form of character string e.g. ``phys'' for physical exercise.
#' @param mediator The mediator name in the form of character string e.g. ``whr'' for waist hip ratio.
#' @param response The outcome name in the form of character string e.g. ``case'' for a stroke case.
#' @param mediator_model A list containing each of the fitted mediator regression models e.g.
#' @param response_model is a regression for the outcome on all mediators together with all parents and confounders of the mediators in
#' a Markov causal Bayesian network DAG e.g.
#' @param response_model_2 is a regression for the outcome on the exposure together with  all parents and confounders of the exposure in
#' a Markov causal Bayesian network DAG along with other risk factors at the same level of the causal Bayesian network DAG. E.G. If
#' physical exercise (``exer'') in the example given in the diagram is the exposure. Then the regression would include all
#' parents of ``exer'' (i.e. sex, region, educ, age) as well as risk factors at the same level of the causal Bayesian network
#' (i.e. stress, smoke, diet, alcoh).
#' @param weights A numeric \eqn{nx1} vector where n is the number of patients in the case control data frame.
#' For case control studies, a reweighting approach is used which assumes the prevalence of disease,
#' \eqn{\pi} is known, and the sampled disease cases and controls are randomly selected from their respective populations.
#' We assume for simplicity that the case to control matching ratio is \eqn{1} to \eqn{r}, for some \eqn{r \geq 1}.
#' Under these assumptions, the components of the PAF can be found as the corresponding empirical expectations
#' and distributions in the reweighted dataset where cases are assigned weights \eqn{1}, and controls are assigned weights
#'  \eqn{(1/\pi âˆ’ 1)/r}. Effectively then we can think of the reweighted population as a random sample.
