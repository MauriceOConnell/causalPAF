#' @description Calculation of Population Attributable Fraction (PAF), with a decomposition of the total PAF into direct
#' and indirect components. It performs one simulation which can be combined with a bootstrap approach to
#' perform multiple simulations. If we think of \eqn{Y_0} as the potential outcome for
#' an individual if they were never exposed to the risk factor, can be directly interpreted as the relative change in
#' disease prevalence if an exposure was absent from the population.
#' Sjolander introduced the ideas of mediation into the literature for PAF, defining a decomposition of the total PAF
#' into direct and indirect components:  and

#' @param data_frame Data frame containing the data. The data frame has cases in rows and variables in columns.
#' @param exposure The exposure name in the form of character string e.g. ``phys'' for physical exercise.
#' @param mediator The mediator name in the form of character string e.g. ``whr'' for waist hip ratio.
#' @param response The outcome name in the form of character string e.g. ``case'' for a stroke case.
#' @param mediator_model A list containing each of the fitted mediator regression models e.g.
#' \code{mediator_model=list(model_list[[6]],model_list[[7]],model_list[[8]])}.
#' @param response_model is a regression for the outcome on all mediators together with all parents and confounders of the mediators in
#' a Markov causal Bayesian network DAG e.g.
#' @param response_model_2 is a regression for the outcome on the exposure together with  all parents and confounders of the exposure in
#' a Markov causal Bayesian network DAG along with other risk factors at the same level of the causal Bayesian network DAG. E.G. If
#' physical exercise (``exer'') in the example given in the diagram is the exposure. Then the regression would include all
#' parents of ``exer'' (i.e. sex, region, educ, age) as well as risk factors at the same level of the causal Bayesian network
#' (i.e. stress, smoke, diet, alcoh).
#' @param weights A numeric n x \eqn{1} vector where n is the number of patients in the case control data frame.
#' Different weighting approaches can be applied as per the literature, Pathway-specific population attributable
#' fractions (PS-PAF) O'Connell and Ferguson (\eqn{2022}), Revisiting sequential population attributable fractions Ferguson, O'Connell and O'Donnell (\eqn{2020}).
#' For more information on weighting, a tutorial paper will be published and linked here when it is published.
#' For example, O'Connell and Ferguson (\eqn{2022}), for a case-control study design, when prevalence pi is known, and
#' the sampled disease cases and controls are randomly selected from their repective populations. We assume for
#' simplicity that the case to control matching ration is \eqn{1} to r, for some r greater than or equal to \eqn{1}.
#' Under assumptions outlined in O'Connell and Ferguson (\eqn{2022}), the components of the PAF can be found as the
#' corresponding empirical expectations and distributions in the re-weighted dataset where cases are assigned the weights,
#' \eqn{1}, and controls are assigned the weights of (((\eqn{1} divided by pi) minus \eqn{1}) all divided by r). Effectively, then we can think of the re-weighted population as a random
#' sample. A tutorial paper will be linked here when published for more information which will show how to apply the weighting for different study designs.
