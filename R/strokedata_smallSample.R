#' @title Fictional ischemic stroke data case control data with risk factors, exposures and confounders
#'
#' @description A fictional standardized international study of ischemic stroke cases and controls in 32 countries
#'              in Asia, Europe, Australia, the Middle East and Africa. Information on key causal and modifiable
#'              risk factors for stroke are included. The risk factors included are healthy eating score
#'              (in tertiles), physical inactivity (yes/no), smoking behaviour (current smoker or ex/no smoker),
#'              alcohol intake (no alcohol, moderate consumption, high consumption), an indicator for stress,
#'              ApoB/ApoA lipid ratio (in tertiles), pre-existing hypertension or high measured blood pressure
#'              (yes/no), waist hip ratio (in tertiles), cardiac risk factors such as atrial fibrillation or
#'              flutter (yes or no) and a diagnosis of diabetes mellitus or elevated HbA1c(yes/no).
#'              One needs to assume a causal graph describing the causal relationships between confounders,
#'              risk factors and disease to implement the methods in the 'causalPAF' package. To do this, it is
#'              helpful to divide the risk factors and exposures into categories depending on whether they are
#'              descriptive of an
#'              individual’s behaviour SB = {Smoking, Alcohol intake, inactivity, diet and stress},
#'              their physiology SP = {High blood pressure, ApoB/ApoA ratio, Waist hip ratio}
#'              and what might be regarded as preclinical disease
#'              SD = {Cardiac risk factors, Pre-clinical diabetes}.
#'              We also consider a set of variables that might be confounders (joint causes of the risk
#'              factor and stroke) for all the listed risk factors. This set of confounders, SC consist of
#'              the individuals and their parents’ education level (in 5 levels from no-education to holding
#'              a college Degree), age, gender and region. Here we make the simplifying assumption that disease
#'              develops in a stage-wise fashion, each stage being represented by one of the sets of variables
#'              just described with variables in earlier stages having causal effects on variables contained in
#'              later stages, but not vice-versa. The ordering of stages is indicated by the sequence,
#'              {SC , SB , SP , SD , Y }, and summarized by the causal graphs in
#'              (O’Connell and Ferguson 2020) <https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.10.15.20212845> and

We chose weights of 0.0035 (for each case) and 0.9965 (for each control), reflective of a yearly incidence of first ischemic stroke of 0.35 per cent, or 3.5 strokes per 1,000 individuals. These weights were chosen according to average incidences across country, age group and gender according to the global burden of disease.}
