\arguments{
\item{data_frame}{Data frame containing the data. The data frame has cases in rows and variables in columns.}

\item{exposure}{The exposure name in the form of character string e.g. "phys" for physical exercise.}

\item{mediator}{The mediator name in the form of character string e.g. "whr" for waist-hip ratio.}

\item{response}{The outcome name in the form of character string e.g. "case" for a stroke case.}

\item{mediator_model}{A list containing each of the fitted mediator regression models e.g.
\code{mediator_model=list(model_list[[6]],model_list[[7]],model_list[[8]])}.}

\item{response_model}{is a regression for the outcome on all mediators together with all parents and confounders of the mediators in
a Markov causal Bayesian network DAG e.g.}

\item{response_model_2}{is a regression for the outcome on the exposure together with  all parents and confounders of the exposure in
a Markov causal Bayesian network DAG along with other risk factors at the same level of the causal Bayesian network DAG. E.G. If
physical exercise ("exer") in the example given in the diagram is the exposure. Then the regression would include all
parents of "exer" (i.e. sex, region, educ, age) as well as risk factors at the same level of the causal Bayesian network
(i.e. stress, smoke, diet, alcoh).}

\item{weights}{A numeric \eqn{n x 1} vector where n is the number of patients in the case control data frame.
For case control studies, a reweighting approach is used which assumes the prevalence of disease,
\eqn{\pi} is known, and the sampled disease cases and controls are randomly selected from their respective populations.
We assume for simplicity that the case:control matching ratio is \eqn{1:r}, for some \eqn{r \ge 1}.
Under these assumptions, the components of the PAF can be found as the corresponding empirical expectations
and distributions in the re-weighted dataset where cases are assigned weights 1, and controls are assigned weights
 \eqn{(1\piâˆ’1)/r}. Effectively then we can think of the reweighted population as a random sample.}

\description{
Path specific population attributable fraction for a mediating pathway.
This metric has several desirable properties. This is a kind of sequential PAF on pathways,
but now corresponding to eliminating the mediating pathway first.
\deqn{PAF_{A->M->Y} = (P(Y=1)-P(Y_{A,M_{0}}=1)/P(Y=1) }
