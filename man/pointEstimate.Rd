}
\arguments{
\item{dataframe}{A wide format dataframe containing all the risk factors, confounders, exposures and outcomes within the causal DAG Bayesian network.}

\item{exposure}{The name of the exposure column variable within dataframe in text format e.g. "phys".}

\item{mediator}{The name of the mediator column variables within dataframe in text format. There can be more than one mediator of interest. It can be a vector of mediators names within the dataframe e.g. c("subhtn","apob_apoa","whr").}

\item{response}{The name of the response column variable within dataframe in text format e.g. "case". The cases should be coded as 1 and the controls as 0.}

\item{response_model_mediators}{A model fitted for the response in a causal Bayesian network excluding ``children'' of the mediators in the causal Bayesian network. See example in tutorial.}

\item{response_model_exposure}{A model fitted for the response in a causal Bayesian network excluding ``children'' of the exposure and risk factors in the causal Bayesian network. See example in tutorial.}

\item{in_outArg}{A list of length 2. The first list contains a list of character vectors of the parents of the exposure or risk factor or outcome which are either causes or confounders of the exposure or risk factor or outcome. The second list contains a list of a single name of exposure or risk factor or outcome in form of characters. See tutorial examples for examples.}

\item{Splines_outlist}{A list defined of same size and order of variables as defined in in_outArg[[2]]. If splines are to be used for variables listed in in_outArg[[2]], then the splines should be defined in the same order as variables appear in in_outArg[[2]]. It is necessary to list variables in in_outArg[[2]] without splines if no spline is to be applied.}

\item{splinesDefinedIn_in_outDAG}{Logical TRUE or FALSE indicating whether the user has defined splines in the causal DAG, in_out, if TRUE. If FALSE and splines are defined in Splines_outlist_Var, then it is necessary for the package to populate the in_out DAG with splines listed in Splines_outlist_Var.}

\item{model_listArg}{is a list of models fitted for each of the variables in in_out$outlist based on its parents given in in_out$inlist. By default this is set to an empty list. In the default setting, the models are fitted based on the order of the variables input in the parameter in_outArg. See the tutorial for more examples. Alternatively, the user can supply their own fitted models here by populating ``model_listArg'' with their own fitted models for each risk factor, mediator, exposure and response varialble. But the order of these models must be in the same order of the variables in the second list of in_outArg. See tutorial for further examples.}

\item{weights}{Column of weights for case control matching listed in the same order as the patients in the data e.g. weights = strokedata$weights.}

\item{NumSimulation}{This is the number of simulatons requested by the user to estimate integrals. The larger the number of simulations the more accurate the results but the longer the code takes to run. Therefore the user may wish to balance speed with accuracy depending on which is of more value in the specific context of interest. The integrals for continuous variables are estimated using simulation methods.}

\item{addCustom}{Logical TRUE or FALSE indicating whether a customised interaction term is to be added to the each regression. The interaction term can include splines.}

\item{custom}{text containing the customised interaction term to be added to each regression. The text should be enclosed in inverted commas. Splines can be included within the interactin terms. See tutorial for examples.}
